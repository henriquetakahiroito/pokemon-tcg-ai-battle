"""Heuristic state evaluation, V(state) from the to-move player's perspective.

Returns a scalar in roughly [-1, 1] where +1 ~ winning. Prize differential
dominates (you win at 0 prizes remaining); board strength, bench safety,
energy development, and special conditions are secondary. This is the v0 leaf
evaluation for MCTS and the basis of the greedy baseline; the learned value net
(Stage 5) augments/replaces it.
